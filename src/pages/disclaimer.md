# Not an official SCNX service, not affiliated with ScootKit

This is an **independent, community-driven project** that operates **entirely separately** from ScootKit and its official SCNX services.  
We would like to make it explicitly clear that this project is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by ScootKit**, the creators and maintainers of SCNX and related technologies.

We do **not represent ScootKit**, nor do we act on its behalf in any capacity. Any references made to SCNX, ScootKit, or other related technologies are solely for **informational, compatibility, or interoperability purposes**.  
This project does not attempt to impersonate, duplicate, or replicate any official ScootKit services, branding, or infrastructure.

Furthermore, we fully acknowledge and respect **ScootKit’s intellectual property rights** and the integrity of its official services. We strive to ensure our work remains clearly distinguishable from official offerings, and we operate in accordance with the principles outlined in the official [SCNX Community Services Policy](https://corp.scootkit.com/docs/scnx/community-services/policy/), including:

- Clear labeling of this service as community-created and unofficial  
- Avoidance of misleading branding or domain names  
- Compliance with open-source and interoperability guidelines  
- No use of official ScootKit infrastructure or proprietary code  

We are committed to transparency, community collaboration, and responsible use of public SCNX resources.  
If you are looking for official SCNX services or support, we strongly encourage you to visit the official ScootKit website at [https://scootkit.com](https://scootkit.com) or access the SCNX platform through officially maintained channels.

Should you have any questions or concerns regarding the nature of this project, please feel free to contact us.  
We remain open to dialogue and will act swiftly to correct any unintentional violations of ScootKit’s community standards.
