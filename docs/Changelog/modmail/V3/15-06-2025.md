Modmail now supports multiple info messages, giving you more flexibility in how information is presented. You can configure your bot to show specific info messages based on the selected ticket topic. If there's only one available option, the dropdown will automatically be replaced with a button for a smoother user experience.

Please note: If you previously had an info message set up, it will need to be reconfigured to work with this new system. And yes multiple info messages per channel are now fully supported.
