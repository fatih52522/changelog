The /ticket-history command has been introduced by SCNX, allowing you to view a userâ€™s previous ticket history directly.

SCNX has also added optional AI-generated summaries for ticket logs, giving you a quick overview without the need to download the full logs.

You can now remove the section about past tickets from the Modmail opening message, as it's no longer necessary.

In addition, numerous improvements and bug fixes have been made, along with some smaller dashboard changes to further enhance the user experience.
