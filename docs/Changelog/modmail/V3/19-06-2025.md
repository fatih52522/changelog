SCNX has fixed numerous small bugs and issues. The ticket system now includes a claiming feature, which needs to be configured separately. Unlike Modmail, directly assigning tickets within the ticket may not always be ideal. Therefore, you can set up a notification channel where team members are alerted about new tickets and can claim them for themselves.
