SCNX has introduced two useful new features. you can now easily import local holidays by selecting your country, and optionally your state. so there’s no need to enter them manually anymore. In addition, the new %openingHours% parameter automatically displays the opening hours for the next 7 days in the user’s local time zone meaning you no longer have to manually include them in your messages.
