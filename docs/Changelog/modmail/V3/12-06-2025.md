SCNX has introduced several improvements to the ticket system that enhance both functionality and user experience. First, the blocklist feature now also applies to the ticket system users who are on the blocklist will no longer be able to open tickets. Please note that the command has changed from /blacklist to /blocklist to reflect more inclusive language and standardization across the platform.

In addition, the dashboard's statistics tab now includes data on the most frequently used ticket topics from Modmail. This gives you better insights into which subjects are brought up most often and can help with managing support and identifying recurring issues.

A completely new feature is the ability to send forms directly within tickets using the /ticket form command. When a form is sent, users will by default not be able to send any messages in the ticket until they have completed the form. However, this behavior is fully configurable and can be adjusted to match your workflow or community needs.

These updates are part of SCNXâ€™s ongoing effort to make Modmail more flexible, transparent, and easier to manage both for support teams and end users.
