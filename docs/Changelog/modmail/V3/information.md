# Information you need to know 
Welcome to the V3 Modmail version of SCNX!
:::danger 
If you decide to switch from the stable version of Modmail to the V3 beta, please keep in mind that this version is still in active development. You should expect bugs, crashes, and overall unstable behavior. It is not recommended for production use, especially if you rely on Modmail for important or everyday communication.
:::

For example, there have already been cases where a user’s bot was unable to start after switching to the beta version, due to unexpected internal errors. The user had to contact support and wait several hours until someone could respond and help resolve the issue. Situations like this can happen at any time while using the beta.

:::info
Access to the V3 beta is not available to everyone. It is currently limited to users with Early Access, which can be unlocked by reaching ScootKit Membership Level 2. You can learn more and upgrade at:
https://membership.scootkit.com
:::

Level 2 membership starts at €3.99/month (billed yearly) or €4.32/month (billed monthly) — these prices apply to users in the EU and may vary depending on your region and local taxes.

Important: If your Early Access expires, your bot will no longer be able to start while it's running on the V3 beta. You will need to switch back to the stable version first in order to use the bot as usual.

Please note that there is no official release date for when the stable version of Modmail V3 will be available. Until then, we recommend staying on the current stable release unless you're comfortable testing beta features and providing feedback.
