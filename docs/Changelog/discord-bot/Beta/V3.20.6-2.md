# Changelog â€“ New Features & Bug Fixes
[V3.20.6-2 in changelog.click](https://scnx.app/de/changelogs/beta-v3.20.6-2)

## Partner-List

### Improvements
- The partner list can now be sent into **channels that are not empty**, even in combination with other supported (!) live-embeds.
- When upgrading to this version, a **new partner list** will be generated. Please manually delete the old one. A link to the current list can be found in your bot logs.
- Added the **`%nr%` parameter**, which shows the number within the current category instead of the database ID.  
  This allows for cleaner, more visually appealing lists and automatically updates when entries are deleted.

## Applications

### Improvements
- Added an option to display a **truncated version of the application content** directly in Discord.

### Bug Fixes
- Previously, if the submission message was deleted, users could no longer apply, and staff could not approve or deny the application.  
  This has been fixed. For new applications, users can now **reapply if the submission message is deleted**.

## Level-System

### Improvements
- The **live leaderboard list** can now also be sent into channels that are not empty, including when using live-embeds.
- When upgrading, a **new leaderboard list** will be generated. Please manually delete the old one. A link to the current version is available in your bot logs.

## AI-Chat-Channel

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where **long responses were being shortened**.  
  Full responses should now be sent correctly.

---

## Custom-Bot Core

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed a bug where the **channel locking feature removed permissions from the bot itself**.  
  This should now work as expected.
