# ðŸ”§ **Update Overview â€“ Improvements & Bug Fixes**

[V3.20.6-1 on changelog.click](https://scnx.app/changelogs/beta-v3.20.6-1)

**Guess the Number**  
A new game channel mode has been added: the "Guess the Number" game now starts automatically in a designated channel. As soon as one game ends, the next one begins. Administrators can also participate.

**Fun Commands**  
Images are now sent as attachments instead of just being displayed as links. Configuration files have also been improved.

**YouTube Notifications**  
Delivery of notifications for new videos has been made more reliable.

**Level System**  
An issue with the live leaderboard was fixed where users who had already left the server were still being counted. The displayed user count is now accurate.

**Birthday Calendar**  
An error in the age calculation for the `/birthday status` command has been corrected.

**Status Roles**  
Member caching has been revised, resolving issues with assigning roles. Support for multiple status values has also been added.

**Custom Bot Core**  
A bug was fixed where custom commands couldn't override disabled module commands.

**Mass Role**  
An issue caused by missing member caches on very large servers (10,000+ members) has been resolved.
