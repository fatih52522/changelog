# SCNX Android V1.0.0.6 Update

**SCNX** is continuously working to meet the technical requirements and guidelines set by various platforms. As part of this effort, an update to the **Play Billing Library** has been initiated to comply with the latest **Google Play publishing requirements**. This step ensures that the app remains eligible for future updates and availability through the Play Store.

Despite these changes, the user experience remains seamless: **New features and improvements on SCNX are available directly within the app â€” without requiring a manual update from the store.** This allows users to access the latest functionality as soon as itâ€™s released.

All updates, changes, and technical improvements are transparently documented in the **changelog**, which is always available at [https://changelog.click](https://changelog.click) and on the official **SCNX Discord server**. ðŸš€ (And in https://scnx-changelog.de ðŸ˜‰)
