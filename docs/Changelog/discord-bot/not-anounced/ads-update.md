# Ads Update to free Users

The ad system has been slightly changed in this update.

If you **donâ€™t pay**, you are required to **watch a video every 7 days** to keep **all your bots online per server**.

### ðŸš« New Behavior When Switching Tabs:

- If you start watching a video and **switch tabs**, the video will **automatically pause**.
- The video will **resume only when you return to the tab and click on Start Video**.
- You must **stay on the same tab**, otherwise the video will **stop every time** you switch tabs or open another application.

These changes are intended to ensure that ads are actually being watched.
