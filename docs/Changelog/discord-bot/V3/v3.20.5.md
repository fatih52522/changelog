[Changelog v3.20.5](https://changelog.click/v3.20.5)


The recent updates encompass various areas of the bot.

Under "Welcome and Boosts," an important adjustment has been made: the bot will now automatically assign welcome roles even if users have not yet completed their Discord onboarding. However, this feature can be disabled via the dashboard if desired.

Furthermore, corrections were made to the "Info Commands"; the /info user command now functions correctly again, after an issue related to the activated Level System was resolved.

The "Level System" itself was also improved by ensuring support for all configuration options for voice XP.

In the "Economy" section, an error with the /shop command was successfully resolved.

The "Custom Bot Core" received minor adjustments, including the integration of a direct link to the configuration in the default status.

Finally, general localization issues were addressed to enhance user-friendliness.
