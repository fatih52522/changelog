[Changelog v3.20.5](https://changelog.click/v3.20.5)


The recent updates in version 3.20.5 cover multiple areas of the bot.

Under **“Welcome and Boosts,”** a significant improvement has been implemented: the bot now automatically assigns welcome roles even if users have not yet completed Discord’s onboarding process. This behavior can be disabled at any time via the SCNX dashboard.

In addition, fixes have been applied to the **“Info Commands”** – the `/info user` command now works as expected again, after resolving an issue that was caused by the enabled Level System.

The **“Level System”** itself has been improved to fully support all available voice XP configuration options.

Within the **“Economy”** category, a bug affecting the `/shop` command has been successfully resolved.

The **Custom Bot Core** has received minor improvements, including a default status that now includes a direct link to the configuration page.

Lastly, general localization issues were addressed to improve clarity and overall user experience.
