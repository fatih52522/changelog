# 👋 Welcome to the Changelog

Welcome to the official SCNX changelog section! Here you'll find all important information about changes, new features, bug fixes, and general developments across our projects – including the Discord Bot, the Modmail system, and other tools.  

All entries are clearly organized into categories like “Discord Bot” or “Modmail” and further divided by version (e.g. Stable, Beta, or V3). This way, you can quickly see what has changed, when it happened, and which version it applies to.  

In addition to technical changes, you'll also find **important announcements and official SCNX news** here. That means: not just changelogs, but also information about new projects, planned updates, or general developments will be published in this section – so you’ll always stay up to date.  

This area is updated regularly. If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, feel free to reach out to us on Discord.  

Thank you for being part of the SCNX community!
